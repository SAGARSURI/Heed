# Heed

As we all know coronavirus is spreading rapidly. The best way to stay healthy is to stay isolated or take proper measures to avoid the virus from entering your body.

During this time, we have to follow certain rules like if you are going out for buying something, you have to stay away from the crowd, put on a mask and maintain a minimum distance of 6ft.

Since this is not the habit we have developed. So to keep you all safe, I have developed an app(Heed) that will notify you to carry a mask and follow certain rules when you leaving home.
In the same way, when you are returning home, it will notify you before a certain distance about cleaning hands and maintain hygiene.
